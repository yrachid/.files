Hi $1, how are you?

Thank you so much for your interest in my profile. That sounds like an amazing opportunity! Unfortunately, I have just recently started at my current job, so I'm not looking for anything new at the moment. I would love to keep in touch for future opportunities.

I have a few contacts back in Brazil that I could refer to that opportunity. If you're interested, please let me know.

I hope you find the perfect candidate for the job!

Thanks again!"
